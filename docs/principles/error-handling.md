# Error Handling Conventions

## Structured Tool Results

Every tool operation returns a `ToolResult` object with `success`, optional `data`, and optional `error` fields. Errors are never thrown past the registry boundary.

```typescript
interface ToolResult<T = unknown> {
  readonly success: boolean;
  readonly data?: T;
  readonly error?: ToolError;
}
```

**Evidence**: `packages/core/src/tools/types.ts:30-34`

**Reason**: Structured results allow agent loops to inspect failure details (error code, message, optional details) without try/catch around every tool call.

## Categorized Error Codes

Tool errors use a `ToolErrorCode` discriminated union:

```typescript
type ToolErrorCode =
  | 'INVALID_PARAMS'
  | 'FILE_NOT_FOUND'
  | 'FILE_NOT_READ'
  | 'READ_FAILED'
  | 'WRITE_FAILED'
  | 'EDIT_FAILED'
  | 'EXECUTION_FAILED'
  | 'TOOL_NOT_FOUND'
  | 'UNKNOWN_ERROR';
```

**Evidence**: `packages/core/src/tools/types.ts:9-18`

**Reason**: Categorized codes let the runtime handle failures by category (e.g., retry on `EXECUTION_FAILED`, prompt user on `FILE_NOT_READ`) without parsing free-form messages.

## Registry-Level Exception Safety

The registry's `execute()` wraps every handler call in a try/catch. Any thrown exception is converted to a `ToolResult` with code `UNKNOWN_ERROR` and the original error in `details`. This guarantees that tool handlers cannot crash the runtime through unhandled exceptions.

**Evidence**: `packages/core/src/tools/registry.ts:53-64`

**Reason**: Handler code may encounter unexpected failures. A thrown exception should become a machine-consumable failure, not propagate as an uncaught error.

## Validation at Entry

Invalid parameters (empty file paths, non-string content, empty commands) are rejected at the start of each tool handler with `INVALID_PARAMS` before any I/O occurs. This prevents partial I/O effects from invalid input.

**Evidence**: Each tool's handler checks required parameters before accessing the filesystem or process. (`packages/core/src/tools/read-tool.ts`, `write-tool.ts`, `edit-tool.ts`, `bash-tool.ts`)

**Reason**: Fail-fast validation prevents wasted I/O and ensures consistent error responses for invalid input.

## Workspace Path Containment

File paths that resolve outside the configured workspace root are rejected with `INVALID_PARAMS` before any filesystem access. The shared async helper `resolveInWorkspace` (`packages/core/src/tools/workspace.ts:39-135`) checks containment at three levels: lexical (fast pass for obvious `../` traversal), realpath-based (for existing targets whose symlinks may point outside), and parent-walk realpath (for new file writes through symlinked directories).

**Evidence**: `workspace.ts:39-135` (containment check), `read-tool.ts:42-44` (read guard), `write-tool.ts:69-71` (write guard), `edit-tool.ts:63-65` (edit guard).

**Reason**: Workspace containment prevents path traversal attacks and ensures the agent operates within its declared workspace boundary. Canonical resolution via `fs.realpath` catches symlink-based escapes that a purely lexical check would miss. Rejecting before filesystem access avoids partial I/O effects on out-of-bounds paths.
